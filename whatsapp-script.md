## Qualification Script (For Human Response)

### Step 1: Acknowledge Quickly
```
Hi [Name], thanks for reaching out! 

I can help with that. Let me ask a few quick questions to give you an accurate estimate:
```

### Step 2: Gather Key Info
1. **Project type:** Kitchen, wardrobe, or both?
2. **Property type:** Terrace, detached, apartment, RPN/STKRJ?
3. **Wet or dry kitchen?** (if kitchen project)
4. **Cabinet length:** Approximately how many meters/feet of cabinets?
5. **Timeline:** When do you need it completed?
6. **Budget:** What's your target budget range? (helps us recommend the right tier)

### Step 3: Provide Ballpark Range
```
Based on what you've shared, projects like yours typically run:

💰 BND [X,000 - Y,000] (depending on finishes and hardware tier)
⏱️ Timeline: [W weeks] from confirmation to install

Would you like me to schedule a site measurement for a detailed quote? Or happy to explain what affects the price first — your choice!

## Follow-Up Cadence (Automated + Manual Hybrid)

### Day 0 (Immediate)
**Auto-reply** with qualification questions (above)

### Day 1 (Manual)
**Ballpark range + case study link**

```
Hi [Name], just following up!

Based on your [X-meter kitchen/wardrobe in Y area], similar projects we've completed run BND [X,000-Y,000].

Here's a recent example:
[Link to case study or portfolio photo]

Want to chat about finishes, timeline, or next steps? I'm here!
```

### Day 3 (Manual)
**Comparison checklist + education**

```
Hi [Name], 

Before comparing quotes from different vendors, I'd recommend asking these 3 questions to make sure you're comparing properly:

1️⃣ What edge sealing method? (EVA at 190°C is the standard for Brunei humidity)
2️⃣ What drawer slides? (DTC or Blum vs generic)
3️⃣ How are drawer boxes built? (18mm vs thin plywood)

Download the full checklist here: [Link to PDF]

These 3 specs reveal build quality. Happy to explain what we use if helpful!
```

### Day 7 (Manual)
**Social proof + soft nudge**

```
Hi [Name],

Just wanted to share what a recent client said after their [kitchen/wardrobe] install in [similar area]:

"[Testimonial snippet or Google review quote]"

Still planning your project? Let me know if you'd like to visit our showroom at The Airport Mall — I can walk you through material samples and show you the difference between hardware tiers!
```

### Day 14 (Manual)
**Soft close with urgency (if applicable)**

```
Hi [Name],

Hope your planning is going well!

Our next available measurement slot is [DATE]. If you'd like me to hold it, just say the word. Otherwise no pressure — reach out whenever you're ready!

Cheers,
[Your Name]

```

### Q: "How long does it take?"
```
Typical timeline:

```

### Q: "What makes you different?"
```
3 things:

1️⃣ Radical transparency
We publish our specs (edge sealing method, hardware brands, drawer construction). Most vendors don't.

2️⃣ CNC precision
Custom-fit to exact millimeter. No modular gaps.

3️⃣ Brunei climate engineering
EVA edge sealing, humidity-resistant materials, corrosion-proof hardware. Built to last 10-15+ years, not 3.
