# Caramella vs Brunei Cabinetry Competitors

## Competitive landscape summary

### What “top competitors” are doing right now
Across the Brunei custom cabinetry/joinery market (kitchens, wardrobes, built-ins), the clearest *observable* competitive pattern is that the highest-performing brands are not trying to win on a single dimension. Instead, they combine **(a) showroom authority**, **(b) fast lead capture via WhatsApp/DM**, and **(c) proof of install capability** (projects, brands, or “authorised distributor” status). citeturn18search2turn15view0turn14search2turn8search2

Concrete examples from the competitor set:
- **Showroom authority + premium brand halo**: My Space Gallery positions itself as a “home solution” provider and lists a long roster of authorised distributor brands (including entity["company","Bosch","home appliances brand"], entity["company","Electrolux","home appliances brand"], entity["company","Häfele","hardware and fittings brand"], entity["company","LIXIL","building products company"]/INAX, etc.), signalling a premium supply chain and “one-stop” buying convenience. citeturn18search2  
- **Design+build + free site visit/quotation CTA**: MR Brunei markets “Design + Build” and explicitly pushes “FREE site visit & quotation” with “Call or WhatsApp” as the conversion path. citeturn14search2  
- **Value-first bundles**: IHome Design advertises a specific “INSTOCK Kitchen Set” with a visible “Price” vs “Original price” and includes “FREE Delivery + FREE Installation,” which is a strong low-friction offer in a price-sensitive segment. citeturn13search2  
- **Established manufacturer credibility**: Kenwood is described (in directory and government industry listings) as established in 1975, and is listed by the Brunei Forestry Department as a timber downstream company producing doors/door frames/furniture/panelling (plus direct links to its website/socials). citeturn20search14turn16view2  
- **Franchise / international design-language premium**: Signature Kitchen’s Brunei presence is framed in directory-style listings using “trusted, reliable product quality” and “Italian inspired kitchen designs,” reinforcing a global-premium aesthetic cue. citeturn10view3  

### Top threats to becoming “#1 brand + #1 sales leader”
Based on *evidence available in accessible sources* (and acknowledging platform access limits noted in the appendix), the primary competitive threats cluster into three types:

**Premium authority aggregators**  
They will compete hardest with Caramella on higher-budget projects because they combine showroom confidence + premium brand associations.
- My Space Gallery: multi-category “home solution” positioning + numerous premium distributor brands. citeturn18search2turn18search3  
- Signature Kitchen: premium positioning and a Brunei showroom footprint (address and operating hours appear in third-party listings and map services). citeturn10view3turn20search0  

**High-volume local custom builders with heavy social proof signals**  
They will compete hardest on acquisition volume and daily inquiry flow because they appear to have scale and persistent posting presence (e.g., high follower/large post counts).
- Hafidh Furniture Custom 2016: IG profile shows ~26K followers and very high post count, and the Facebook page lists a large physical unit footprint/address. citeturn7search1turn7search5  
- BRU Furniture: IG profile emphasises “CUSTOM MADE CABINET” and shows a significant follower count; Facebook page frames it as “HOME INTERIOR DESIGN CUSTOM FURNITURE CONSTRUCTION.” citeturn7search0turn7search15turn23search1  

**Offer-led “one-stop” renovators + financing narrative**  
They will compete hardest in the mid-market by reducing purchase friction via financing, bundles, and simple CTAs.
- BYOSIS Lifestyle Design: “Kitchen Cabinet, Wardrobe & Laminate Flooring,” plus financing angle (“BIBD AT-Tamwil Bank Loan is Available”) and premium hardware mentions (Blum). citeturn8search1turn8search4turn8search5  
- Modern Living / Sci-Eco: explicitly positions as “one-stop centre provider” with end-to-end services; promotions and price-led hooks show active offer marketing. citeturn3search3turn3search38  

## Customer decision drivers in Brunei

### Evidence-based drivers visible in competitor messaging
These drivers are ranked by how frequently they are emphasised (directly or indirectly) across the competitor set and by how concretely they are operationalised via CTAs, offers, and proof.

**Purchase friction reduction through financing and “approved vendor” signals**  
Multiple brands explicitly mention financing, and Brunei’s entity["company","BIBD At-Tamwil Berhad","brunei consumer finance"] publishes a “Consumer Product Financing Vendors” list that includes Caramella Trading Company, BYOSIS Lifestyle Design, Kenwood Furniture Trading Company, and Sci-Eco Kitchen and Wardrobe (among many others). citeturn28view0turn28view1turn8search4  
Implication: customers are primed to ask, “Can I finance this?” and sellers who make financing feel safe and simple likely win more enquiries.

**Price clarity and “package” anchors**  
The market shows both ends: (a) value/bundle anchors (e.g., IHome Design’s priced instock set with free delivery/install), and (b) premium “range transparency” that frames quality comparisons (Caramella’s price brackets and “compare properly” guidance). citeturn13search2turn15view2  
Implication: customers are comparing quotes and need an anchor to judge fairness (price) and durability (specs).

**Showroom trust and “touch the materials” behaviour**  
Many players repeatedly drive showroom visits (Caramella’s Airport Mall showroom; My Space Gallery’s showroom-led promotions; IHome’s showroom prompts; Creative Cabinet as “visit our showroom”; MR Brunei’s showroom prompts in older posts). citeturn15view0turn18search1turn23search6turn20search5turn14search10  
Implication: in a high-ticket category, visual + tactile reassurance remains central; “showroom authority” is a conversion lever.

**Proof/authority via brands, standards, and technical claims (especially humidity)**  
Brunei’s national meteorology service describes Brunei’s climate as “hot and wet throughout the year,” supporting why cabinetry durability (humidity handling) matters in buyer psychology. citeturn26search0  
Caramella’s site repeatedly positions “built to handle Brunei’s humidity,” and goes further by giving “spec answers” (edge sealing method, hardware tiering, drawer box construction). citeturn15view0turn15view2  
Implication: the brand that documents a “build standard” can convert hesitation into trust—especially against players selling mostly aesthetics.

**Response speed and consultation flow**  
Caramella promises response “within 1 business day.” citeturn15view1  
IHome Design even publishes “Steps to prepare quotation” (appointment → site visit → quotation), which suggests consumers value predictable process. citeturn23search2  
Independent research indicates speed-to-lead is a major determinant of qualification/conversion (HBR’s “Short Life of Online Sales Leads” is widely cited for this). citeturn25search0  
Implication: a disciplined WhatsApp-first “speed + structure” sales system can be a measurable advantage.

### Hypotheses to verify (not proven in captured sources)
- **Termite/borer anxiety impacting “material choice” language** (HYPOTHESIS): Likely relevant in tropical climates, but not explicitly surfaced in the accessible competitor snippets captured here.  
- **Cross-border (Miri/Limbang) cabinetry shopping** (HYPOTHESIS): plausible regional behaviour, but this report did not capture compelling evidence of Miri/Limbang firms actively targeting Brunei in the last 24 months.

## Market structure and positioning map

### Category segmentation (Brunei cabinetry/joinery)

**Budget/value segment (price-anchored, bundles, “instock”)**  
Characterised by explicit “package pricing,” discounts, and free installation/delivery. IHome Design’s instock set with price + free delivery/install is a clear indicator. citeturn13search2  
BRU Furniture also looks positioned for broad custom work with WhatsApp-first conversion, likely competing on accessibility (pricing not visible in captured snippets, but the positioning is generalist). citeturn7search0turn23search1  

**Mid segment (one-stop renovation + financing + showroom)**  
Characterised by “design+build,” “free site visit/quotation,” financing language, and cross-sell categories (flooring, blinds, appliances). MR Brunei, BYOSIS, and Modern Living/Sci-Eco align here in conversion mechanics. citeturn14search2turn8search4turn3search38  

**Premium segment (showroom authority + premium brands + documented specs)**  
Characterised by imported brand ecosystems and/or documented craftsmanship/precision claims. My Space Gallery (brand roster + showroom scale), Signature Kitchen (premium design narrative), and Caramella’s own positioning (“premium cabinetry & joinery,” CNC precision, humidity handling) all live here. citeturn18search2turn18search3turn10view3turn15view0  

### Positioning map (Price vs Proof/Authority)

**Axes**
- **X-axis: Price** (value → premium)  
- **Y-axis: Proof/Authority** (casual contractor → documented standard + showroom authority)

**High price / high proof (desired “#1” corner)**  
- Caramella already signals “premium cabinetry & joinery,” CNC precision, quantified project count, and explicit humidity-handling narrative. citeturn15view0turn15view2  
- My Space Gallery competes through distributor authority and showroom scale claims. citeturn18search2turn18search3  
- Signature Kitchen competes through premium design language and brand halo. citeturn10view3turn20search8  

**Mid price / mid proof (largest volume battleground)**  
- MR Brunei: strong CTA system (free site visit/quotation, WhatsApp) and “premium fittings” language. citeturn14search2  
- BYOSIS: financing + distributor status + hardware brand mention. citeturn8search4turn8search2turn8search5  
- Modern Living/Sci‑Eco: strong “one-stop” operation and promo cadence. citeturn3search3turn3search38  

**Value / varying proof (price-first)**  
- IHome Design: discounted instock + free install/delivery. citeturn13search2  
- BRU Furniture: generalist custom cabinet + WhatsApp conversion. citeturn23search1turn7search0  

**High proof but value-mid due to local scale (social proof powerful, technical proof unclear)**  
- Hafidh: large-scale social presence; proof of activity is strong, but technical standard/warranty isn’t captured in accessible sources. citeturn7search1turn2search2  

**Implication for “Caramella wins”**  
Caramella’s clearest path to #1 is to **own the “High proof/authority” axis** more aggressively than anyone else by turning what is already present on the website (precision, humidity narrative, spec answers, price ranges) into a *systematic proof engine* across social, paid, and showroom. citeturn15view0turn15view2

## Caramella win strategy

### Positioning statement (one sentence + proof + why now)

**Positioning (1 sentence)**  
Caramella is Brunei’s premium cabinetry & joinery brand that designs around real daily routines and builds with CNC precision for Brunei’s hot, wet climate. citeturn15view0turn26search0  

**Proof points (3) grounded in current Caramella assets**
- **Precision & process proof**: “PRECISION STANDARD ±0.1MM CNC” is stated on the homepage. citeturn15view0  
- **Scale proof**: “600+ Completed Projects” is stated on the homepage. citeturn15view0  
- **Technical proof content**: Caramella publicly answers spec questions (edge sealing method, hardware tiering, drawer construction) in the pricing/knowledge content. citeturn15view2  

**Why now (evidence-based market timing)**  
Competitors are using financing and “free consult/quote” CTAs to increase volume, and Brunei’s financing ecosystem explicitly includes cabinetry players (Caramella and key competitors appear on the BIBD At‑Tamwil vendor list). citeturn28view0turn28view1turn14search2  
Caramella is uniquely positioned to pair that demand-capture tactic with documented standards (few competitors publish anything comparable in accessible captures). citeturn15view2  

### Offer architecture (Good / Better / Best) built from observed market offers

Competitor offers show two conversion levers that consistently appear: **(1) free consult/measurement/quotation** and **(2) financing availability**. citeturn14search2turn8search4turn9search28turn28view0  
Caramella should keep these, but differentiate via *tier clarity + documented build standard*.

**Good (Value‑Smart Premium)**  
Designed to defeat value competitors *without racing to the bottom*. Benchmarks: IHome’s priced instock packages. citeturn13search2  
- Materials: laminate/Formica-class surfaces (aligned to Caramella’s own form options). citeturn15view1  
- Hardware: defined “reliable tier” (publish what it is). Caramella already discusses tiered runners. citeturn15view2  
- Service: free measurement + 3D layout review (only if unit economics allow; otherwise “rebate when sign”).  
- Warranty: baseline workmanship warranty + a written “handover checklist signoff” (see below).

**Better (Core Premium)**  
Designed to win the broad “most homes” bracket Caramella already publishes (BND 6,000–18,000). citeturn15view2  
- Materials: upgraded finishes; wet-area detailing; edge sealing standard. citeturn15view2  
- Hardware: premium concealed runners in standard spec where justified. Caramella already references entity["company","Blum","cabinet hardware manufacturer"] “TANDEM concealed runners” as a common spec choice. citeturn15view2  
- Add-ons: pantry systems, drawer optimisation. citeturn15view2  

**Best (Flagship / Architectural Joinery)**  
Designed to outflank Signature Kitchen and My Space on “authority + documentation,” not only aesthetics. citeturn10view3turn18search2turn15view0  
- Materials: premium feature panels, integrated appliances-ready planning.  
- Service: “design clarity” workshops (workflow mapping) + site readiness checklist before fabrication (Caramella already lists site readiness as timeline driver). citeturn15view2  
- Proof pack: “3D vs Reality” + timeline + cost range + spec sheet + care guide (Caramella already uses the “3D vs Reality” motif in social snippets). citeturn9search5turn9search10  

**Risk reversal (must be specific, not generic)**
- Publish a “Caramella Installation Handover Checklist” and have the client sign it at completion (hinge alignment, drawer smoothness, door reveals, silicone sealing for wet areas, appliance clearances). This converts “trust” into a repeatable proof object.  
- Add a “response SLA” for after-sales issues (e.g., triage within 24h business time), because speed-to-response is a proven performance driver in lead handling and should also apply to after-sales credibility. citeturn25search0  

### Acquisition system tied to observed competitor behaviour

**Organic content pillars (built to outperform competitor patterns)**  
Competitors repeatedly use: showroom pushes, promo hooks, and “free quote/site visit” CTAs. citeturn20search5turn18search1turn14search2turn3search38  
Caramella should keep CTAs but win by *education + proof density*:

1) **Portfolio proof (but structured)**: “Problem → Design intent → Spec choices → Timeline → Result.” This builds on Caramella’s own published “Price/Timeline/Process” guidance. citeturn15view2  
2) **Education that helps buyers compare**: Caramella already instructs buyers to compare edge sealing, drawer slide tier, and moisture handling. Turn these into short weekly reels/posts. citeturn15view2  
3) **BTS + CNC credibility**: The homepage explicitly mentions CNC precision and ±0.1mm standard. Film machine processes and QC checks to make this “real.” citeturn15view0  
4) **Customer stories + showroom walk-throughs**: Competitors push showroom; Caramella’s showroom is in Airport Mall with clear hours. Use “bring a floor plan” hooks. citeturn15view0turn3search15  

**Paid Meta funnel: awareness → proof → WhatsApp conversion**
Competitors use direct WhatsApp CTAs heavily (MR Brunei, Creative Cabinet, Caramella). citeturn14search2turn20search5turn15view0  
Use entity["company","Meta Platforms","parent of facebook"] click-to-WhatsApp ads, which Meta documents as a supported workflow in Ads Manager. citeturn25search2  

A Brunei-appropriate structure:
- **TOF (video)**: 15–30s “3D vs Reality + humidity standard” montage (hook options in swipe file below).  
- **MOF (case study)**: “Kitchen in Brunei: BND range + timeline + what’s included” using Caramella’s own published bracket language as the frame. citeturn15view2  
- **BOF (retargeting)**: “Send 1 photo + cabinet length + move-in date” (Caramella already asks for these). citeturn15view2  

**Google Business Profile domination**
Google states local ranking is based mainly on relevance, distance, and prominence—so review velocity, completeness, and consistent activity are strategic (not optional). citeturn25search1  
Caramella already links “View on Google Maps” from the homepage. citeturn15view0  
Action: turn GBP into a weekly operating rhythm (posts, Q&A, photo updates, review requests), not a static listing.

**SEO landing pages (Caramella already has a head-start)**
Caramella’s “Kitchen Renovation Guide” page already targets the core intent cluster: price ranges, timelines, and how to compare quotes. citeturn15view2  
Next pages to build (because competitor market shows price bundles + categories):
- “Kitchen cabinet Brunei price” (expand the BND chart + inclusions) citeturn15view2  
- “Custom wardrobe Brunei price” (mirror kitchen structure; Caramella links to wardrobe pricing guide). citeturn15view2  
- “Wet kitchen cabinet Brunei” (tie to “humidity” + moisture handling proof; Brunei climate is hot and wet). citeturn26search0turn15view0  

### Sales system upgrades (WhatsApp-first, evidence-based)

Speed-to-lead matters because leads decay quickly; HBR’s “Short Life of Online Sales Leads” is a canonical reference about slow response harming conversion. citeturn25search0  
Caramella currently states “We’ll respond within 1 business day,” but to become #1, make an operational goal of **first response within 5 minutes during business hours** and measure it. citeturn15view1turn25search0  

**WhatsApp qualification script (ready to deploy)**
Use Caramella’s existing inquiry form fields as the WA structure (timeline, budget range, floor plan, dry/wet kitchen, finishes, appliances). citeturn15view1  

Message 1 (instant reply):
> Thanks for messaging Caramella. To give you an accurate range today, can you share:  
> 1) Location (area)  
> 2) Is this new build or renovation?  
> 3) Target move-in date  
> 4) Budget range (ballpark is fine)  
> 5) 1 photo OR floor plan + estimated cabinet length (in feet/metres)

This mirrors the site’s “Send: 1 kitchen photo, approximate cabinet length, and your target move‑in date.” citeturn15view2  

**Follow-up cadence**  
Use Day 1/3/7/14 but make it “value follow-up” (send a comparison checklist, a case study, a spec explanation). This leverages Caramella’s published comparison guidance (“ask about edge sealing, drawer slide tier, and moisture handling”). citeturn15view2  

## Prioritised action plan and execution roadmap

### Ranked action plan (ICE scoring)

Scoring scale: Impact (1–10), Confidence (1–10), Ease (1–10). “Confidence” reflects strength of evidence that the action maps to market drivers and competitor tactics visible in captured sources.

| Action | Why this matters (tied to evidence) | I | C | E | ICE | KPI |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Publish and package “Caramella Build Standard” into 1‑page PDF + showroom wall | Competitors rely on brand/distributor trust; Caramella can win with documented standards and humidity narrative already present. citeturn18search2turn15view2turn15view0turn26search0 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 504 | Close rate ↑, AOV ↑ |
| Turn “Price/Timeline/Process” into a weekly content series (reels + carousel) | Price anchors are used by value competitors; Caramella already has ranges and comparison advice—convert into top-of-funnel assets. citeturn13search2turn15view2 | 9 | 8 | 8 | 576 | Leads/week ↑, qualified lead % ↑ |
| Implement WhatsApp speed-to-lead SLA + tracking | Competitors push WA; HBR highlights lead decay; Caramella already promises 1 business day—tighten to minutes & measure. citeturn14search2turn20search5turn25search0turn15view1 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 392 | Response time ↓, consult booked rate ↑ |

| Finance-first landing + sales script (“approved vendor” clarity) | Financing is a visible market lever; BIBD vendor list includes Caramella and key competitors, so it’s a legitimising signal. citeturn28view0turn28view1turn8search4 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 384 | Lead-to-close %, AOV |

| Google Business Profile operating rhythm (reviews + photos + Q&A weekly) | Google confirms ranking factors; GBP is a key demand capture point; many competitors rely on showroom/local discovery. citeturn25search1turn15view0turn18search1 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 343 | Calls/messages from GBP ↑, reviews/month ↑ |

| “Site readiness checklist” gate before fabrication + schedule lock | Caramella already lists site readiness as a timeline driver; formalising reduces delays and increases satisfaction/referrals. citeturn15view2 | 6 | 7 | 7 | 294 | Install lead time ↓, NPS ↑ |

### 90-day execution plan (weekly)

**Week 1–2: Proof system foundation**
- Draft “Caramella Build Standard” (1-page) directly from existing published spec answers + humidity narrative + CNC claims. citeturn15view0turn15view2  
- Create showroom “Materials & Edges Wall”: sample board + edge banding examples + “wet area vs dry area” explanation (ties to Brunei climate). citeturn26search0  
- Implement WhatsApp tracking links and response-time logging (instrumentation checklist below).  

**Week 3–4: Content engine launch**
- Start weekly series: “Compare Properly” (edge sealing, runner tiers, humidity handling) using Caramella’s own phrasing. citeturn15view2  
- Publish 2 case studies with the template: “layout → timeline → price bracket → what’s included.” citeturn15view2  
- Train sales team on the WhatsApp qualification script (mirror inquiry form). citeturn15view1  

**Week 5–6: Paid acquisition + retargeting**
- Launch Meta click-to-WhatsApp campaign with:
  - Video proof (CNC/installation montage)
  - Retargeting case study ads  
  Meta officially supports ads that click to WhatsApp. citeturn25search2  
- Add a financing explainer: “How BIBD At‑Tamwil works + what we need from you” (tie to vendor list). citeturn28view0  

**Week 7–8: Google Business Profile sprint**
- Weekly GBP photo update + completed project posts; start review request engine (templates below).  
- Publish GBP Q&A: “What’s the typical price range?” using website ranges. citeturn15view2turn25search1  

**Week 9–10: Offer tiering + quote template**
- Update quote template to show Good/Better/Best with clear differences (hardware, finishing, warranty, lead time).  
- Add “site readiness checklist” into the quoting process to reduce timeline variability. citeturn15view2  

**Week 11–12: Partnerships + referral loop**
- Build a referral kit for interior designers / agents: “Build Standard + commission policy + case study library.”  
- Pilot a “Referral Thank You” system (voucher/upgrade) with tracked codes.

### 12-month roadmap (quarterly)

**Quarter 1: Dominate proof + speed**
- Scale content library to 20+ case studies with downloadable PDFs.
- Achieve consistent response time SLAs and track conversion metrics (below).

**Quarter 2: Dominate “financing + premium clarity”**
- Co-build a financing landing page and showroom script: “approved vendor + what’s included + how to compare” using the published BND brackets. citeturn15view2turn28view0  

**Quarter 3: Partnership moat**
- Appliance + fittings partnerships (co-promos, bundled upgrades). My Space’s distributor strategy shows consumers respond to ecosystem trust. citeturn18search2  

**Quarter 4: Operational moat**
- Standardise installation QA, aftercare response SLA, and post-install review capture.
- Launch “annual maintenance check” as a loyalty/upsell engine (cabinet alignment checks, hinge tuning).

### Swipe file (hooks, angles, formats, WA scripts)

**Hooks/angles observed in-market (and how Caramella should “out-proof” them)**
- “FREE site visit & quotation” (MR Brunei) → Caramella version: “Free measurement + you get a written spec checklist + timeline plan.” citeturn14search2turn15view2  
- “Discounted instock kitchen set + free install” (IHome) → Caramella version: “Entry tier with published price bracket + upgrade path, not ad-hoc discounting.” citeturn13search2turn15view2  
- “Authorised distributor” (My Space, BYOSIS) → Caramella version: “Authorised-grade hardware list + documented standards (edge sealing temperature/process, runner tiers).” citeturn18search2turn8search2turn15view2  

**Post formats that fit Brunei buyer behaviour (showroom + WhatsApp)**
- “3D vs Reality” split-screen (Caramella motif) with caption: “BND range + timeline + what’s included.” citeturn9search5turn15view2  
- “Bring your floor plan” reels (Modern Living style) but add “we’ll reply with a realistic estimate if you send 1 photo + cabinet length.” citeturn3search15turn15view2  
- “Material micro-lessons” (edge sealing, drawer runners, wet kitchen design). citeturn15view2turn26search0  

**WhatsApp scripts (conversion + objection handling)**
- Price objection: “We publish realistic ranges for Brunei homes. Which bracket feels right for you: BND 2.5–6k / 6–18k / 18k+? Then we’ll show what changes between them.” citeturn15view2  
- Trust objection: “We build for Brunei humidity—here are the exact edge sealing method + runner tiers we use, and a handover checklist you sign at completion.” citeturn15view2turn26search0  
- Timeline objection: “Timeline depends on site readiness; here is the readiness checklist that protects your schedule.” citeturn15view2  

### Risks, constraints, and “do-not-copy” items

**Risks/constraints**
- **Platform visibility constraints**: Facebook page access was intermittently blocked during capture, and Instagram pages often surface only as snippets; this limits verified insights on post cadence and customer review themes for some competitors. citeturn11view0  
- **Google review verification constraints**: Many Google Maps pages require JavaScript; review counts/ratings were not reliably captured for all competitors, so “Google rating & count” is frequently UNKNOWN. citeturn20search13turn21search12  

**Do-not-copy items**
- **Pure price racing**: IHome’s visible discounting can win volume but can also compress margin; Caramella should keep a value entry, but differentiate on documented standard, not endless promos. citeturn13search2turn15view2  
- **Over-broad “one-stop” without proof**: Modern Living/Sci‑Eco and BYOSIS show breadth; Caramella should avoid becoming a generalist unless it can keep its premium proof density. citeturn3search3turn8search6turn15view0  

## KPI dashboard, instrumentation, and evidence packs

### KPI dashboard definition (what to track weekly)

**Acquisition**
- Leads/week (by channel: organic social, paid Meta, GBP, website form)
- Cost per lead (paid)
- Click-to-WhatsApp conversation starts (paid + organic)

**Speed & process**
- Median first response time (WhatsApp)  
- Consult booked rate = consults/leads
- Quote issued rate = quotes/consults

**Sales**
- Quote-to-close %  
- Average order value (AOV)  
- “Tier mix” (Good/Better/Best share)

**Delivery & quality**
- Install lead time (measurement → install completion)  
- Rework rate (jobs needing return visit within 30 days)  
- Warranty claims/month

**Trust & referrals**
- New reviews/month (GBP)  
- Review-to-lead contribution (GBP Insights)  
- Referral rate = referral leads / total leads  
- Simple satisfaction score post-install (1–5)

### Tracking & instrumentation checklist

- **WhatsApp tracking**: use unique “click to chat” links per channel (site, IG bio, FB, ads). Meta supports click-to-WhatsApp ad flows; tag each campaign. citeturn25search2  
- **UTM discipline**: UTMs on every website button (“Get a Quote”, “Book a Measurement”) and map clicks.  
- **GBP rhythm**: weekly post + photo uploads; Google confirms local ranking factors rely on relevance/distance/prominence. citeturn25search1  
- **Simple CRM sheet**: lead source, timestamp, response time, budget bracket, project type (new/reno), stage, outcome. Mirror Caramella’s inquiry form data to minimise friction. citeturn15view1
