# Compare Your Quotes Properly
## The 3-Question Checklist for Brunei Cabinetry

---

**Don't compare price alone.**  
Compare what you're actually getting.

Most cabinet failures in Brunei happen because of **hidden shortcuts** in materials and construction — not because the customer chose a cheaper option, but because they didn't know what to ask.

This checklist reveals build quality in 3 simple questions.

---

## Question 1: What Edge Sealing Method Do You Use?

### Why It Matters
Cabinet edges are the **most vulnerable point** for moisture damage. If water gets into the core material through an unsealed or poorly sealed edge, the board swells, warps, and eventually fails.

In Brunei's high-humidity environment (80%+), **edge sealing is the first line of defense** against moisture ingress.

### The Good Answer
**EVA (Ethylene-vinyl acetate) hot-melt adhesive applied at 190°C using an automatic edge banding machine.**

- Creates a **waterproof bond** between edge tape and board
- Resists steam, heat, and cleaning chemicals
- Standard in quality cabinetry across Singapore, Malaysia, and premium Brunei projects

### The Bad Answer
**PVC edge tape applied with weak adhesive** (or no clarity on bonding method)

- Peels off when exposed to steam, heat, and water
- Common in budget cabinetry to save costs
- Results in peeling edges within 1-2 years in wet kitchens

### Red Flags
- "We use edge tape" (but no mention of bonding method)
- "Standard edge sealing" (no technical details)
- Vendor can't answer the question

## Question 2: What Drawer Slides?

### Why It Matters
Drawer slides support **daily use** and determine how smooth, quiet, and durable your drawers feel. Cheap slides sag, jam, and rust in humid environments.

You'll open kitchen drawers **10,000+ times** over the cabinet's life. Hardware quality matters.

### The Good Answer
**DTC side-mount ball-bearing soft-close slides** (standard tier)  
OR  
**Blum TANDEM concealed soft-close undermount slides** (premium tier)

- Proven brands with **corrosion-resistant finishes**
- Load ratings: 30-65kg depending on model
- Soft-close damping prevents slamming
- **10-year+ lifespan** under normal use

### The Bad Answer
**Generic no-name slides** (or no brand mentioned)

- Springs and plastic guides instead of ball bearings
- Rust in Brunei's humidity
- Sag under weight, jam when drawers expand in moisture
- Typical lifespan: 2-3 years before replacement needed

### Red Flags
- "High-quality slides" (but no brand name)
- "Soft-close" (but no brand or load rating)
- Vendor doesn't know the slide brand or can't show samples

## Question 3: How Are Drawer Boxes Constructed?

### Why It Matters
Drawer box construction determines **structural rigidity and longevity**. A weak drawer box separates at the joints, sags under weight, and loses alignment over time.

Drawer boxes in Brunei need to resist humidity **and** daily load cycles.

### The Good Answer
**18mm boards with pocket-screw joints** (or dovetail joints for solid wood)

- 18mm thickness = rigid, stable structure
- Pocket-screw joints create strong mechanical connection
- Edge-sealed on all exposed sides for moisture resistance
- Drawer box won't sag or separate under normal loads (up to 30kg)

### The Bad Answer
**Thin plywood (9-12mm) with stapled or glued joints**

- Thin boards = weak structure, prone to sagging
- Stapled joints pull apart when drawers expand/contract in humidity
- No edge sealing on interior = moisture absorption, eventual failure
- Common in budget cabinetry to reduce material costs

### Red Flags
- "Standard drawer boxes" (no thickness or joinery method mentioned)
- Vendor can't explain drawer box construction
- Quote doesn't specify drawer box material

## How to Use This Checklist

### 1. Ask Every Vendor
When you request a quote, include these 3 questions:

> "What edge sealing method do you use?"  
> "What drawer slides?"  
> "How are drawer boxes constructed?"

### 2. Compare Answers Side-by-Side
Create a simple table:

| Vendor | Edge Sealing | Drawer Slides | Drawer Box |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vendor A | EVA at 190°C | Blum TANDEM | 18mm pocket-screw |
| Vendor B | PVC tape | Generic soft-close | Standard |
| Vendor C | Not specified | DTC side-mount | 12mm plywood |

### 3. Decide Based on Value, Not Price Alone
**Lower price + weak specs = hidden cost** (replacement in 3-5 years)  
**Fair price + strong specs = better long-term value** (10-15+ year lifespan)

---

## What If a Vendor Can't Answer?

If a vendor can't clearly answer these 3 questions, they are either:

1. **Using budget materials** and don't want to disclose it
2. **Outsourcing fabrication** and don't know their own build specs
3. **Not tracking quality standards** systematically

In any case, it's a **red flag**. Premium vendors document their specifications and can explain them clearly.

---

## Bonus: Other Specs Worth Checking

Once you've covered the big 3, ask about:

- **Base cabinet legs:** Adjustable plastic legs ≥100mm? (lifts cabinets off floor, prevents water damage)
- **Hinge finish:** Nickel-plated or stainless steel? (resists rust in humidity)
- **Board type:** Melamine-faced or raw MDF? (melamine face = moisture barrier)
- **Warranty:** What's covered, for how long, and what are exclusions?
