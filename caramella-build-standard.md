## Premium Cabinetry & Joinery for Brunei

### What "Premium" Means at Caramella

Premium isn't about the highest price — it's about **engineered choices for Brunei's climate and daily life**. Every specification below is selected to resist humidity, last longer, and perform better in tropical conditions.

---

## 1. Board Materials

### Carcass & Panels
- **Melamine-faced particleboard or MDF** (18mm standard, 16mm for select applications)
- **ENF-grade emission standard** where specified (ultra-low formaldehyde)
- **Factory-applied melamine face** creates moisture barrier on panel surfaces

### High-Moisture Areas
- **Marine-grade plywood** (18mm) for outdoor kitchens, under-sink cabinets, and semi-open wet areas
- **Aluminum carcass option** for extreme exposure (coastal properties, fully outdoor installations)

### Door & Drawer Fronts
- **19mm melamine-faced boards** for solid doors
- **Acrylic, glass, or solid wood** for premium finish options
- All materials selected for dimensional stability in humidity

---

## 2. Edge Sealing

**Method:** EVA (Ethylene-vinyl acetate) hot-melt adhesive applied at **190°C** using automatic edge banding machine

**Why EVA?**
- Creates waterproof bond between edge tape and board
- Resists steam, heat, and cleaning chemicals
- Does not peel or separate like weak PVC tape

**Application:** All exposed edges on doors, drawer fronts, carcass panels, and shelves

---

## 3. Hardware

### Drawer Slides

#### Standard Tier
- **DTC side-mount ball-bearing soft-close slides**
- Load rating: Up to 45kg (typical)
- Corrosion-resistant finish for humid environments

#### Premium Tier
- **Blum TANDEM concealed soft-close undermount slides**
- Load rating: 30-65kg depending on length
- Full extension, hidden from view when drawer is open
- Nickel-plated corrosion resistance

### Hinges
- **European-style concealed hinges** (Blum or equivalent)
- **Nickel-plated or stainless steel finish** (not basic steel that rusts)
- Soft-close damping standard on all doors
- Adjustable in 3 dimensions for perfect alignment

### Handles & Accessories
- **Aluminum or stainless steel handles** (customer choice)
- **Corrosion-resistant coating** for long-term durability
- Internal fittings (cutlery trays, drawer organizers) customized per project

---

## 4. Drawer Box Construction

**Material:** 18mm melamine-faced boards (not thin plywood or MDF)

**Joinery:** Pocket-screw joints for rigid box construction

**Edge Sealing:** EVA edge sealing on all exposed edges

**Result:** Rigid, stable drawer boxes that resist sagging and moisture damage

---

## 5. Base Cabinet Specifications

### Adjustable Legs
- **100mm minimum height** (adjustable plastic legs)
- Lifts cabinet off floor to prevent water contact
- Allows airflow underneath to reduce moisture accumulation
- Adjustable for uneven floor leveling

### Kickboards
- **PVC or aluminum** (not MDF wrapped in vinyl)
- Waterproof and easy to clean
- Snap-on installation for access to legs

### Drainage & Protection
- Drip edges on countertops to prevent water runoff into cabinet faces
- Floor protection recommendations included in quote

---

## 6. Manufacturing Process

### Digital Workflow
1. **Site measurement** → AutoCAD 2D/3D layout
2. **Design confirmation** → Client approval on layout, materials, finishes
3. **CNC fabrication** → Panels cut to ±0.1mm tolerance
4. **Edge banding** → Automatic machine, EVA at 190°C
5. **Assembly & QA** → Pre-assembly check, hardware installation
6. **Delivery & Install** → On-site fit, seal, align, handover

### Precision Standard
- **CNC-cut panels** to exact millimeter dimensions
- **Custom-width cabinets** (not modular sizes with wasted space)
- Scribe panels used only to contour uneven walls — not to hide gaps from undersized modules

---

## 7. Timeline

| Phase | Duration |
|---|---|
| Site measurement & initial concept | 1-3 days |
| Design finalization & quotation | 3-7 days |
| Fabrication (post-confirmation) | 4-8 weeks* |
| Installation | 2-7 days* |

*Depends on project size and complexity

---

## 8. Moisture & Climate Protection

### Wet Kitchens
- EVA edge sealing (critical for water exposure)
- Elevated base cabinets (100mm legs)
- Corrosion-resistant hardware
- Ventilation planning (exhaust fan/hood recommendations)

### Dry Areas (Wardrobes, Dry Kitchens)
- Standard moisture protection (EVA edge sealing)
- Regular hardware (DTC or Blum depending on tier)
- Climate-appropriate finishes

### Outdoor/Semi-Open Areas
- Marine plywood or aluminum carcass
- Stainless steel hardware
- Weather-resistant edge sealing and finishes
- Proper drainage design

---

## 9. Warranty & Service

**Workmanship:** 1 year from installation date

**Coverage:** Defects in fabrication, installation errors, hardware malfunction under normal use

**Exclusions:** Damage from accidents, misuse, alterations by third parties, or failure to follow care instructions

**Service Response:** Contact via WhatsApp (+673 718 7185) or email (caramellabrunei@gmail.com). We aim to assess service requests within 2 business days.

- Remove water splashes and grease before they dry

### Weekly
- Clean cabinet exteriors with damp microfiber cloth
- Avoid soaking joints or edges

### Monthly
- Check under-sink cabinets for leaks

## 11. Compare Properly: 3 Questions to Ask Every Vendor

When comparing cabinetry quotes, ask:

1. **What edge sealing method do you use?**
   - ✅ EVA at 190°C (waterproof, durable)
   - ❌ PVC tape with weak adhesive (peels in steam/heat)

2. **What drawer slides?**
   - ✅ DTC side-mount or Blum TANDEM (proven reliability)
   - ❌ Generic no-name slides (sag, jam, rust)

3. **How are drawer boxes constructed?**
   - ✅ 18mm boards with pocket screws (rigid, stable)
   - ❌ Thin plywood or stapled joints (weak, separates over time)

These 3 specs reveal build quality. Don't compare price alone — compare what you're actually getting.
