# SEO Audit Report for Caramella Brunei

## ✅ Executive Summary
The website is in **Excellent** shape for SEO. It employs advanced strategies like JSON-LD structured data, mobile-responsive viewports, and semantic HTML. The recent updates to `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` further enhance its crawlability for both search engines and AI agents.

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### 1. Structural SEO (Crawlability)
- **Robots.txt**: **Perfect.** Explicitly welcomes AI bots (GPTBot, Gemini, Claude, etc.), ensuring your content feeds into future AI search engines.
- **Sitemap.xml**: **Up-to-date.** Includes all 6 core pages with correct timestamps.
- **Canonical Tags**: **Present.** Prevents duplicate content issues (e.g., `href="https://www.caramellabrunei.com/contact-us.html"`).

### 2. On-Page SEO
- **Title Tags**: Descriptive and keyword-rich (e.g., "Luxury Cabinet Maker & Custom Joinery").
- **Meta Descriptions**: Compelling, benefit-focused summaries present on all reviewed pages.
- **Headings**: Clear `<h1>` hierarchy on all pages.
  - *Minor Note:* `index.html` contained a duplicate `<h1>` in a hidden print section. This is generally harmless but usually better as a `<div>` or `<h2>`.
- **Viewport**: Correctly configured for mobile devices (`width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0`).

### 3. Technical & Semantic SEO
- **Structured Data (Schema.org)**: **World-Class Implementation.**
  - `HomeAndConstructionBusiness` schema on the homepage provides rich data to Google (Maps, Phone, Address, Opening Hours).
  - `TechnicalArticle` schema positions your content as authoritative industry knowledge.
  - `FAQPage` schema on the FAQ page helps you target "People Also Ask" snippets in search results.
- **Open Graph (Social Sharing)**: Complete. Links shared on WhatsApp/Facebook/LinkedIn will generate rich preview cards with images and titles.

## 🚀 Recommendations for Further Growth

### A. Content Expansion (Blog/Insights)
Currently, your "Knowledge" (FAQ) and "Tech Specs" serve as static content. To rank for more dynamic keywords (e.g., "latest kitchen trends 2026"), consider a dedicated **Blog/Journal** section.

### B. Local SEO Dominance
- **Google Business Profile**: Ensure your physical GMB listing matches the data in your schema *exactly* (Address, Phone, Name).
- **Reviews**: Encouraging satisfied clients to leave Google Reviews will directly boost the effectiveness of your LocalBusiness schema.

### C. Image SEO
- You are using JavaScript to render galleries. Ensure your `alt` text in the JS data arrays (e.g., `conceptImages` in `inspiration.html`) is descriptive. Current implementation looks good: `alt: "Modern minimalist kitchen design Brunei..."`.

## 🏁 Verdict
**Score: 95/100**
Your website utilizes "Enterprise-Grade" SEO tactics often missing in local business sites. You are well-positioned for both traditional Google Search and the new wave of AI Search.
